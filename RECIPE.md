Step 1 Prepare the besan mixture -
To prepare this recipe, grate the jaggery in a small bowl and keep it aside. Now, take a separate bowl and add gram flour, ginger-chilli paste, turmeric, red chilli powder, 1/2 teaspoon asafoetida, jaggery, oil and tamarind paste to it.

Step 2 Wash and remove veins of the colocasia leaves -
Now add water along with salt and mix well until it turns into a smooth paste. On the other hand, wash the colocasia leaves and place them on a chopping board. With the help of a knife, carefully remove the veins from the centre of the leaves.

Step 3 Apply the besan mixture on the leaves -
Next, apply the besan mixture on one leaf and place another leaf over it. Make sure that the mixture is evenly coated. Continue this procedure with other leaves.

Step 4 Roll up the leaves & steam -
Now carefully roll the leaves and steam in a steamer for about 20 minutes. When it cools down, cut the leaves into 1-inch slices.

Step 5 Heat oil & add mustard seeds & asafoetida -
Heat oil in a pan over medium flame and add mustard seeds and sesame seeds to it. Now add the remaining asafoetida along with sesame seeds and wait for them to crackle.

Step 6 Saute the rolled Patras -
Now add the Patras and gently saute them for a minute. Serve hot with any chutney of your choice. You can even garnish it with fresh coriander leaves.
